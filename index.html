				<h2>Game History</h2>
					<p>Let me start this off by saying that league of legends has been launched for 9 years, and Hero's of the Storm has only been out for little over 3. Right then and there you can clearly say that most, if not all of the info from HoTs(Hero's of the Storm) has been taken from league of legends. league of legends takes a lot of their game style and configuration from older genres, making their game seem dated but with a modern feel. Even after the 5 year difference in release dates, HoTs has still taken their basic feel and interactions straight from League of Legends core game style. League of legends also has over 100 million MONTHLY active users, while HoTs only has 80 million in total, active and not active</p>

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
					<p>Yes i do understand that HoTs has put in some of their own mechanics and game types, that is why i wont go as far as saying that they copied the full game over. If i actually wanted to call out game creators for copying a project i would talk about paragon, but we never speak of that game, ever again... In my personal opinion I just feel like if your going to copy some parts of another game, you really need to consider the fact that people aren't going to like it if you dont have a something special that makes in fun. If people wanted to play a game that was like league, they would play league, it's as simple as that.
				<br><br>
				<h2>Community</h2>
					<p>Everyone that knows about league of legends, knows that its community isn't the greatest to be around, but thats not what i wanted to talk about. League of legends has create a large scale competition for fans of their game to come together to compete on a global scale, this ends with the best team in the world teaming up with the designers at LoL(league of legends) to make skins based around themselves and they end up making the skins public for everyone to see. A couple other instinces of this would be when LoL teamed up with the make-a-wish foundation to help a large LoL fan create a skin for people to remember him by after he passed away. This is the kind of stuff that makes me like the people behind LoL.
